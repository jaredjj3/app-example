# app-example

The purpose of this repository is to test the understanding of the MikroORM library.

## Prerequisites

In order to run the tests in this project, you must have:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)

## Running Tests

Jest will run any tests in src/**/*.test.ts in a Docker container. To run the tests, simply run:

```
yarn start
```

Jest will detect any file change events in the src directory, and rerun the tests if idle.

To quit out of the tests, you can press `q` (or as the Jest prompt suggests) or by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

## Debugging Container

If you just want to run bash inside of the test container, just run:

```
yarn debug
```

Inside the container, you will have access to the MikrORM CLI via `yarn mikro-orm`.
